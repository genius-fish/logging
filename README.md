# Genius Logging

In a serverless world, you don't need ten thousand options for writing log files: Console output works just fine.
Combined with the excellent sourcecode library, logging can be very simple and very efficient. Genius Logging is just that:
An extremely simple, pure Scala logging library without any dependencies on the usual suspect Java logging libraries
and without any reflection.

There is some room for performance improvement, using Scala macros.
